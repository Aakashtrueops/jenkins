Jenkins Job - A Jenkins job is a sequential set of tasks that a user defines. For example, a job can fetch source code from version control, compile the code, run unit tests, and more. Note that in Jenkins, the term “job” is synonymous with “project”.


Jenkins Project - A Jenkins project involves steps and post-build actions and is a repeatable build job. There are limitations in the types of actions you can perform in a build step or post-build action. Within a Jenkins freestyle project, there are several standard plugins available to help you overcome this problem.
